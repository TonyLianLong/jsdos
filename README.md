jsdos
=====

A emulator which is written in JavaScript to run DOS system.<br />
But this DOS is not MS-DOS,it's a system which is written by myself in ASM,it's easy to know how it works.<br />
The code support isn't full,but for my system,it's enough.You can edit the files and add the code support.<br />
